  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
  <h3 id="description">Description</h3>
  <p>The Beast Temple is a large, untaimed wilderness, filled with dense <strong>forests</strong>, winding <strong>rivers</strong>, and towering <strong>mountains</strong>. It is a place where nature reigns supreme, and venturing inside is both thrilling and dangerous.</p>
  <p>There is something unnerving about the place, <strong>mysterious stones and pillars</strong> are scattered throughout the land, covered in strange carvings and symbols. Blood stains the ground in certain areas, and the occasional bones of unfortunate travellers can be found. It is a land of danger, and <strong>sacrifices must be made</strong> in order to treck through.</p>

  <h3 id="inhabitants">Inhabitants</h3>
  <p>Almost nobody lives here, apart from a few <strong>hermits</strong> and <strong>hunters</strong> who have chosen to make their homes in the wilderness. The vast majority of the inhabitants are <strong>wild animals</strong>, ranging from small <strong>Vermins</strong>, <strong>Insects</strong> and <strong>Fish</strong>, to larger <strong>Canine</strong>, <strong>Hooved</strong> or <strong>Avian</strong> creatures. <strong>Reptiles</strong> and <strong>Amphibians</strong> can also be found in certain areas, as well as a few <strong>Cryptids</strong>.</p>

  <h3 id="hierarchy">Hierarchy</h3>
  <p>The Beast Temple is ruled by <a href="wiki_index.html?page=leshy">Leshy</a>, a powerful Scrybe who has a deep connection with nature. He sees beasts as the noblest form of life, and believes that they should be respected and protected. Despite this, he still has his <strong>henchmen</strong> which he relies on to keep the temple in order and to challenge any intruders.</p>
  <p>These henchmen all exploit the resources of the land in different ways. <a href="wiki_index.html?page=prospector">The Prospector</a> searches for <strong>gold</strong>, while <a href="wiki_index.html?page=angler">The Angler</a> fishes the rivers and lakes for <strong>food</strong>. <a href="wiki_index.html?page=lumberjack">The Lumberjack</a> harvests the forests for <strong>wood</strong>, and <a href="wiki_index.html?page=trapper">The Trapper</a> hunts the wild animals for <strong>fur and meat</strong>, trading some of it with outsiders.</p>

  <h2 id="progression">Progression</h2>
  <p>There is a clear, set path through the temple that the player must follow in order to reach <a href="wiki_index.html?page=leshy">Leshy</a>'s cabin. However, this path is not without its challenges, as the player must face and defeat each of Leshy's henchmen in order to progress.</p>

  <table class="wiki-table">
    <tr><th>Order</th><th>Name</th><th>Description</th><th>Boss</th></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>???</td><td>???</td><td><a href="wiki_index.html?page=prospector">The Prospector</a></td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td>???</td><td>???</td><td><a href="wiki_index.html?page=angler">The Angler</a></td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td>???</td><td>???</td><td><a href="wiki_index.html?page=lumberjack">The Lumberjack</a></td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td>???</td><td>???</td><td><a href="wiki_index.html?page=trapper">The Trapper/Trader</a></td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>Each area has its own challenges and way of being traversed, both shaped by the environment and the exploitation of its resources. The player must adapt to each area, using different strategies and tactics to overcome the obstacles in their way.</p>
  <p>The henchmen will all be found at the end of their respective areas, and will challenge the player as instructed by Leshy. If the player manages to defeat them, they will be able to proceed to the next area. Once all four henchmen have been defeated, the player can finally reach <strong>Leshy's cabin</strong> and face him in a final showdown.</p>
