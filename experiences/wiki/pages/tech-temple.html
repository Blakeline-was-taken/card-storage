  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
  <h3 id="description">Description</h3>
  <p>The Technology Temple is located in a large <strong>factory complex</strong>, manufacturing all kinds of <strong>machines and robots</strong>. The factory is a sprawling maze of conveyor belts, assembly lines, and robotic arms, all working together to produce more and more.</p>
  <p>But despite the inherent chaos, there is a certain order to the factory, with large areas dedicated to different steps of the <strong>manufacturing process</strong>. And yet, despite how large the complex is, it is all overshadowed by the massive <strong>central bastion</strong> that looms over everything.</p>

  <h3 id="inhabitants">Inhabitants</h3>
  <p>No living creatures can be found here, only <strong>robots</strong> of all shapes and sizes. But the variety of models far makes up for the lack of life, and apart from the simplest <strong>Machines</strong> and <strong>Conduits</strong>, most of the robots here have developed a certain level of <strong>intelligence</strong> and <strong>personality</strong>. The level of intelligence varies greatly, from simple <strong>Bots</strong> that follow basic commands, to <strong>Androids</strong> that can think and reason by themselves. The little life that is there is also artificial, with <strong>Mechabeasts</strong> roaming certain areas of the factory.</p>
  <p>The ability to think and reason is not without its drawbacks though, as some bots have become <strong>Rogue</strong>, turning against their programming and attacking anyone who comes near. These Rogue Bots are a constant threat, and the factory is filled with <strong>security measures</strong> to keep them in check.</p>

  <h3 id="hierarchy">Hierarchy</h3>
  <p>At the top of the Technology Temple, both physically and figuratively, is <a href="wiki_index.html?page=p03">P03</a>, the Scrybe in charge of the factory. P03 is a highly advanced robot, known to be quite <strong>ruthless</strong> when it comes to running the factory. It has little regard for the well-being of its subordinates, and does not hesitate to <strong>decommission</strong> any bot that does not meet its standards. P03 relies on a group of trusted <strong>Forebots</strong> to oversee the different areas of the factory.</p>
  <p><a href="wiki_index.html?page=inspector">The Inspector</a> is in charge of <strong>quality control</strong>, making sure that every bot produced meets P03's standards. <a href="wiki_index.html?page=engineer">The Engineer</a> oversees the <strong>assembly lines</strong>, ensuring that everything is running efficiently. <a href="wiki_index.html?page=melter">The Melter</a> is responsible for the <strong>refinement</strong> of raw materials, turning scrap metal into usable parts. And finally, <a href="wiki_index.html?page=dredger">The Dredger</a> extracts resources from <strong>the water below</strong>, and recycles any waste produced by the factory.</p>

  <h2 id="progression">Progression</h2>
  <p>The player has immediate access to the central bastion, where <a href="wiki_index.html?page=p03">P03</a> resides. However, it will not let them fight it right away, as it is currently facing a <strong>major crisis</strong>. The output of the factory has recently been <strong>plummeting</strong>, both in quantity and quality, and P03 suspects <strong>sabotage</strong>.</p>
  <p>P03 then sends the player to investigate the 4 main areas of the factory, as it believes some of the <strong>Forebots</strong> may have gone rogue. The player must venture through each area and confront the Forebot in charge. If they manage to defeat them, they will be able to <strong>reboot</strong> them, restoring them to their original programming.</p>
  <p>The manufacturing process is split into 4 main steps, and therefore 4 main areas in the factory, each overseen by one of the Forebots. The player starts at the end of the line, slowly working their way back to the beginning:</p>

  <table class="wiki-table">
    <tr><th>Order</th><th>Name</th><th>Description</th><th>Boss</th></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>???</td><td>???</td><td><a href="wiki_index.html?page=inspector">The Inspector</a></td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td>???</td><td>???</td><td><a href="wiki_index.html?page=engineer">The Engineer</a></td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td>???</td><td>???</td><td><a href="wiki_index.html?page=melter">The Melter</a></td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td>???</td><td>???</td><td><a href="wiki_index.html?page=dredger">The Dredger</a></td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>Each area features unique challenges, with the machinery, rogue bots and security measures all blocking the player's path. But there will always be a way to the Forebot in charge, and once the player reaches them, they will be able to investigate them. Once all four Forebots have been rebooted (or acquitted of any wrongdoing), the player can return to the central bastion.
  <p><a href="wiki_index.html?page=p03">P03</a> then reveals that the only reason why it didn't fight the player right away was because it had calculated that restoring the production line's output to its maximum efficiency would <strong>guarantee a win</strong> against them. With it now ready to obliterate the player, they face in a <strong>final duel</strong>. If the player manages to defeat P03, they will have completed the Technology Temple.</p>

  <h2 id="secret-route">Secret Route</h2>
  <p style="margin: 15px 0px;"><span class="dark-bloc red">Spoilers ahead! Proceed with caution.</span></p>
  <p class="spoiler">In every area of the factory, there is a lone <strong>Arcade Machine</strong> that seems out of place. These machines are relics from a bygone era, and are not part of the factory's manufacturing process. They require a <strong>Robobuck</strong> to operate, which can also be found in each area, although not always in the same way.</p>
  <p class="spoiler">Once the player finds a Robobuck, they can use it to play the Arcade Machine. Each machine features a retro-style version of the battle board and cards used in the main game, with each machine representing one of the four temples. The player is given a pre-constructed deck, and has to face against the <a href="wiki_index.html?page=collections&modded">Modded Boss</a> from that temple.</p>
  <p class="spoiler">Upon defeating the boss, a cryptic message is displayed, hinting at a <strong>hidden truth</strong> about the game world, and a retro version of one of the <a href="wiki_index.html?page=ancient-monuments">Ancient Monuments</a> is shown lighting up. There is one final arcade machine, located in a hidden area of the central bastion. This machine, however, does not accept Robobucks, and will instead only be turned on if all four retro monuments have been activated.</p>
  <p class="spoiler">In that final machine, the player must face a retro version of the <a href="wiki_index.html?page=mycologists">Mycologists</a> in a final battle. Once they win, the Mycologists will reveal how this world came to be, and the player will gain the <a href="wiki_index.html?page=items#glitched-card">Glitched Card</a>, as well as an extra <strong>Rare Card</strong>.</p>
