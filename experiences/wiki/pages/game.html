  <h2 id="progression">Progression</h2>
  <p>The game starts with the player choosing a <a href="wiki_index.html?page=categories&Temples">Temple</a> to start out in. They must then select a <a href="wiki_index.html?page=decks">Starter Deck</a> from that temple to use, and assemble a <strong>Side Deck</strong> from the three Side Deck Cards available in the temple.</p>
  <p>The overarching goal of the player is to unlock access to the <a href="wiki_index.html?page=monuments">Ancient Monuments</a>, which will only be accessible after defeat all 4 <a href="wiki_index.html?page=categories&Scrybes">Scrybes</a>. <strong>Temples</strong> all have 5 distinct <a href="wiki_index.html?page=categories&Areas">Areas</a> that the player must pass through, each of them housing a <a href="wiki_index.html?page=categories&Bosses">Boss</a> and the last area housing one of the <strong>Scrybes</strong>.</p>
  <p>Once all the Scrybes are beaten, the Player can access the Monuments, in which a final challenge awaits them.</p>

  <h2 id="exploration">Exploration</h2>
  <h3 id="area-order">Area Order</h3>
  <p>The player will always start by exploring the <strong>first area</strong> of their starting Temple, but after beating the boss of that area, they may explore <strong>any other area of their choice</strong>, provided they are next in line for the temple they reside in.</p>
  <p>So, for example, if the Player started off in the <a href="wiki_index.html?page=beast-temple">Beast Temple</a>, their choices for the next areas to explore are the first area of the <a href="wiki_index.html?page=undead-temple">Undead</a>, <a href="wiki_index.html?page=tech-temple">Technology</a> and <a href="wiki_index.html?page=magick-temple">Magick</a> temples, or the second area of the <a href="wiki_index.html?page=beast-temple">Beast Temple</a>.</p>
  <h3 id="area-layout">Area Layout</h3>
  <p>Each Area has a Map Layout, which consists of a <strong>Grid of Hexagonal tiles</strong>. The Player is represented by a figurine, and on the grid are scattered a variety of <a href="wiki_index.html?page=events">Events</a> that the player may activate by going on them. On the board are also scattered <strong>Enemy figurines</strong>, which will trigger a <a href="wiki_index.html?page=battles">Battle</a> if the Player comes in contact with them.</p>
  <p>The player moves 1 tile at a time, and every time they move, enemies that have spotted them also move 1 tile. If the player is caught in a situation where two or more enemies reach them at the same time, an <strong>Ambush</strong> occurs and they must engage a <a href="wiki_index.html?page=battles#hard-battles">Hard Battle</a>, which will be more dangerous but award greater rewards.</p>
  <p>All Areas have a <strong>Boss Tile</strong>, which will trigger the Bossfight of that area, and put an end to the exploration of that particular place.</p>

  <h2 id="deckbuilding">Deckbuilding</h2>
  <p>The events found in each area allow the Player to progressively build their deck, allowing them to gain cards, modify them, or discard them. They are also able to edit the contents of their <strong>Side Deck</strong> at any time outside of battle, provided they use side deck cards of their starting temple.</p>
  <p>On top of their deck, the player is also able to collect <a href="wiki_index.html?page=items">Items</a> and <a href="wiki_index.html?page=boons">Boons</a>. Items have special effects during battle (unless otherwise noted) and have to be used by the Player. Boons also have special effect during battle, but cannot be manually activated. They, however, do not deplete once used.</p>
  <p>Finally, the Player has a special <strong>Clover</strong> that they can use <strong>Once per Area</strong>. This Clover can reroll the outcome of an event, letting the Player try their luck again.</p>
  
  <h2 id="battles">Battles and Death</h2>
  <h3 id="normal-battles">Normal Battles</h3>
  <p><a href="wiki_index.html?page=battles">Battles</a> are a test of strength, in which the player must defeat the Opponent by bringing the <strong>Scales</strong> all the way to their end. However, their Opponent will attempt to do the same, and if the Scales reach the Player's end, they will <strong>lose a candle</strong>.</p>
  <p>The Player has <strong>Two Candles</strong> per Area, and if both go out, they lose the entire run and have to start again. If the Player manages to win the Battle, they will gain <strong>Foils</strong> equal to the amount of <strong>extra damage</strong> they dealt to the scales.</p>
  <p><a href="wiki_index.html?page=battles#hard-battles">Hard Battles</a> behave identically to normal battles except they have a special mechanic on top that puts the Player at a disadvantage. If they manage to win, however, they will get double the amount of foils they would normally get out of that encounter.</p>
  <h3 id="boss-battles">Boss Battles</h3>
  <p>If the Player reaches the <strong>Boss</strong> with both of their candles still intact, one of their <strong>Candles</strong> will be snuffed out as the battle begins, but they will get an extra card to compensate.</p>
  <p><strong>Boss Battles</strong> are divided into <strong>two phases</strong>, represented by 2 candles that the Player must snuff out. Upon reaching the Boss's end of the Scales a first time, one of their Candles will snuff out and the <strong>Scales will be reset</strong>. The Player then has to reach the end of the scales again in order to finally win.</p>
  <p>Upon finishing the <strong>first phase</strong>, the Player will shuffle the cards in their <strong>Discard</strong> to their deck of origin, as it would be unfair otherwise. Defeating a Boss will reward the Player with a choice of 3 <strong>Rare Cards</strong> from the current Temple, and access to the next area.</p>
  <h3 id="scrybe-battles">Scrybe Battles</h3>
  <p><strong>Scrybe Battles</strong> behave identically to Boss battles except they have <strong>3 phases, indicated by 3 candles</strong>.</p>

  <h2 id="secret-routes">Secret Routes</h2>
  <p style="margin: 15px 0px;"><span class="dark-bloc red">Spoilers ahead! Proceed with caution.</span></p>
  <p class="spoiler">In each Temple, there is a <strong>Secret Route</strong> that the Player can take instead of following the normal progression. These routes are hidden and require the Player to find clues in order to access them.</p>
  <p class="spoiler">Each Secret Route has its own unique challenges and rewards, and often culminates in a battle against a powerful <strong>Secret Boss</strong>. Successfully completing a Secret Route will reward the Player with unique <strong>Talking cards</strong> and items that cannot be obtained through normal progression.</p>
  <p class="spoiler">These Items can allow the Player to access a secret, true ending. More information about each Temple's Secret Route can be found on their respective pages.</p>

  <h2 id="ending">Ending</h2>
  <p style="margin: 15px 0px;"><span class="dark-bloc red">Spoilers ahead! Proceed with caution.</span></p>
  <p class="spoiler">Once the Player has defeated all 4 Scrybes and accessed the <a href="wiki_index.html?page=monuments">Ancient Monuments</a>, they will face a final challenge, a fight against <strong>shadows of the 4 scrybes</strong>. This battle is unwinnable, and the ending is always the Player losing and having to restart their cycle. As to commemorate their pseudo-victory, however, they will be able to <strong>bring 1 card of their deck</strong> with them on their next run.</p>
  <p class="spoiler">However, if the Player has completed all 4 <strong>Secret Routes</strong> and they will be able to access a hidden final battle against <a href="wiki_index.html?page=mycologists">The Mycologists</a>. If they manage to defeat them, they will unlock the true ending of the game.</p>
