  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
  <h3 id="description">Description</h3>
  <p>The Magick Temple occupies an island with mystical properties, with <strong>magickal gems</strong> embedded in the ground. It's a place of learning and growth, where those who seek to master the arcane arts come to study.</p>
  <p>While there are a bunch of places within the temple dedicated to study the magickal arts, by far the most interesting place is the <strong>Clocktower</strong>, a massive structure that seems to defy the laws of physics. It stretches high into the sky, piercing the clouds and disappearing into the upper atmosphere. The Clocktower is said to be a place of great power, where the most skilled magick users can <strong>tap into the fabric of reality</strong>.</p>

  <h3 id="inhabitants">Inhabitants</h3>
  <p>The island is populated by a variety of magick users, which make up most of the temple's inhabitants. Depending on how skilled they are, they are ranked as <strong>Mage</strong>, <strong>Sage</strong> and finally <strong>Wizard</strong>. There are also <strong>Magicians</strong>, which are performers that use magick for entertainment purposes, and <strong>Knights</strong> that prefer using magick to enhance their combat abilities in order to protect the temple and its inhabitants.</p>
  <p>They use <strong>Mox</strong> as magick conduits, glowing crystals that can be found throughout the island. Mox can be used to cast spells, but also to create magickal <strong>Constructs</strong> or to summon <strong>Familiars</strong>, creatures that assist their masters in various tasks. This is no easy task, however, and many magickal experiments have gone awry, leading to the creation of <strong>Aberrations</strong>, twisted and dangerous creatures that roam the island.</p>
  <p>Most mysterious of all, however, are the <strong>Cultists</strong>. These individuals have turned their backs on the temple and its teachings, instead choosing to worship an unknown entity. They are often seen performing dark rituals in the shadows, using forbidden magick and sacrifices for unknown purposes. They are rumored to be the cause of the <strong>Corrupted</strong> nature of some of the island's inhabitants, twisted by their dark magick.</p>  

  <h3 id="hierarchy">Hierarchy</h3>
  <p><a href="wiki_index.html?page=magnificus">Magnificus</a> is the Scrybe of the Magick Temple, and is regarded as the most powerful magick user on the island. The Clocktower was his creation and is his domain, he is the sole reason why magick users desperately try to surpass themselves. Those who are deemed worthy by him can become his apprentices, learning directly from the master himself.</p>
  <p>These <strong>Pupils</strong> are <a href="wiki_index.html?page=goobert">Goobert</a>, <a href="wiki_index.html?page=amber">Amber</a>, <a href="wiki_index.html?page=lonely-wizard">the Lonely Wizard</a> and <a href="wiki_index.html?page=blank-sage">the Blank Sage</a>. They are the closest to pass the Scrybe's teachings, and, as part of their final test, they reside in <strong>Pocket Dimensions</strong> within the Clocktower, where they await the arrival of challengers to prove their worth.</p>
  <p>In the Magick temple, the highest honor and the most prestigious reward, what every magick user aspires to, is to one day be good enough to get <strong>inscrybed</strong> by <a href="wiki_index.html?page=magnificus">Magnificus</a> himself, becoming a part of his deck. This is what makes the Scrybe of Magicks so important to his temple, moreso than any other Scrybe. Everything revolves around him, and the temple is shaped around the goal he represents.</p> 

  <h2 id="progression">Progression</h2>
  <p>The entire temple takes place inside the Clocktower, which is divided into 4 main floors, each representing a different stage of magickal mastery. Each floor is guarded by one of <a href="wiki_index.html?page=magnificus">Magnificus</a>'s pupils, who serve as bosses that must be defeated to progress to the next floor.</p>
  <p>The issue is that the Pupils are nowhere to be seen in their respective floors. What can be found, however, are <strong>Mox Pillars</strong> that lead to their <strong>Pocket Dimensions</strong>, where they await challengers to prove their worth. Each Pocket Dimension is a unique environment that reflects the personality and abilities of its resident Pupil, filled with traps, puzzles, and opponents that must be overcome to reach the boss.</p>

  <p>Each Area is different in terms of environment, enemies, and challenges. But all of them require the player to solve some riddle to activate the Pillar, and all of them have the objective of reaching the <strong>Pupil</strong>, which, upon defeat, will open the way to the next floor of the Clocktower.</p>
  <p>The final floor is <strong>Magnificus's Study</strong>, where the Scrybe himself awaits the player. <a href="wiki_index.html?page=magnificus">Magnificus</a> has the ability to foresee the future, and as such, has prepared for the player's arrival by setting one final pocket dimension to serve as a proper battle area. He puts the player through a <strong>final duel</strong>, using every aspect of magick the player has seen up to this point and more. If they win, they will have completed the Magick Temple.</p>
  <h2 id="secret-route">Secret Route</h2>
  <p style="margin: 15px 0px;"><span class="dark-bloc red">Spoilers ahead! Proceed with caution.</span></p>
  <p class="spoiler">The Secret Route of the Magick Temple has to do with the <strong>Cult</strong>. In each pocket dimension, there is a hidden <strong>Cultist</strong> that can be found by exploring the area thoroughly. They willask the player to <strong>offer some of their blood</strong> to show their allegiance, and if they do so, they will be given a unique kind of <strong>gem</strong>, before disappearing. Offering blood is not without consequence, however, as it will make the scales start at the player's <strong>Candle</strong> for every battle in the area.</p>
  <p class="spoiler">If the player manages to find the first 3 Cultists and earn their unique gem, when they reach the 4th area, they will not find a cultist, but a special altar instead. By placing the 3 gems on the altar, the player will be given a <strong>Bloodied Key</strong>, which can be used to open the <strong>Basement</strong> of the Clocktower, a hidden area that serves as the Cult's secret lair. The Basement seems to have been closed off for a while, as it is in a state of disrepair, and in the center lies a <strong>ritual circle</strong>, surrounding a strange <strong>Mox pillar</strong>, this one adorned with a skull.</p>
  <p class="spoiler">Interacting with the pillar will transport the player to a unique pocket dimension, the <a href="wiki_index.html?page=cult-sanctum">Cult Sanctum</a>, where the rest of the Cult has been trapped. The player must fight a strange, powerful <strong>Abomination</strong> that has been created as a result of the ritual, and which blocks anyone from exiting the realm. Upon being defeated, the <strong>Abomination</strong> will drop a <a href="wiki_index.html?page=items#fungal-disk">Fungal Disk</a>, which the Cultists let the player keep as thanks for freeing them. They also give them a <strong>Rare Card</strong>.
