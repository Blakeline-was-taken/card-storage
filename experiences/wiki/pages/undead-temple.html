  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
  <h3 id="description">Description</h3>
  <p>The Undead Temple occupies the largest island, strangely shaped like a large skeletal hand. The whole island is like a gigantic Graveyard, where the dead are brought back to life in order to die again in an endless cycle.</p>
  
  <h3 id="inhabitants">Inhabitants</h3>
  <p><strong>Zombies</strong>, <strong>Skeletons</strong> and <strong>Ghosts</strong> are plentiful here, with <strong>Demons</strong> often leaving their realm to visit this one. This land is considered a sacred space, where the living can commune with the dead. Some have devoted their lives to protect and maintain this place, hence the large amount of <strong>Knights</strong> and <strong>Workers</strong> present.</p>
  
  <h3 id="hierarchy">Hierarchy</h3>
  <p>The Undead Temple is ruled by <a href="wiki_index.html?page=grimora">Grimora</a>, a powerful Scrybe who has mastered the art of necromancy. Despite her somewhat fearsome appearance, she is known to be quite kind and caring towards her subjects, knowing each and every one of them by name.</p>
  <p>By far her favorites though are the 4 Ghouls that rule over the 4 main areas of the temple: <a href="wiki_index.html?page=kaycee">Kaycee Hobbes</a>, <a href="wiki_index.html?page=sawyer">Sawyer Patel</a>, <a href="wiki_index.html?page=cornelius">Cornelius Timberton</a> and <a href="wiki_index.html?page=royal">Royal Domingues</a>. They are extremely loyal to Grimora, and do their best to keep the temple running.</p>

  <h2 id="progression">Progression</h2>
  <p>The main goal is to reach Grimora's inner sanctum, locked inside the <a href="wiki_index.html?page=crypt">Crypt</a>, where she resides. But the doors of the crypt are <strong>sealed</strong>, preventing anyone from entering. To open them, one must fill in the <strong>4 missing parts</strong> of the epitaph carved on the door. Each part is held by one of Grimora's <strong>Ghouls</strong>, who will only give them up to those who prove their worth.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <div class="alert danger">This still needs to be written! But hopefully it will be cryptic.</div>
    <p>The epitath written on the door.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The player must then venture through the 4 main areas of the temple, each ruled by one of the Ghouls, and complete their challenges to obtain the parts of the epitaph. Technically, they could go in any order, but since some areas are more difficult than others, they are restricted to the following order:</p>
  <table class="wiki-table">
    <tr><th>Order</th><th>Name</th><th>Description</th><th>Boss</th></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>???</td><td>???</td><td><a href="wiki_index.html?page=kaycee">Kaycee Hobbes</a></td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td>???</td><td>???</td><td><a href="wiki_index.html?page=sawyer">Sawyer Patel</a></td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td>???</td><td>???</td><td><a href="wiki_index.html?page=cornelius">Cornelius Timberton</a></td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td>???</td><td>???</td><td><a href="wiki_index.html?page=royal">Royal Domingues</a></td></tr>
  </table>
  <p>Every area has its own way of doing things, and its own unique challenges. But they all provide a way of <strong>summoning the Ghoul</strong> in charge of the area, usually by completing a special task or puzzle. Once summoned, the Ghoul will challenge the player to a <strong>duel</strong>, and if they win, they will receive their part of the epitaph.</p>
  <p>Once all 4 parts are collected, the player can return to the Crypt and use them to unlock the door. Inside, they will find Grimora, who will challenge them to a <strong>final duel</strong>. If they win, they will have completed the Undead Temple.</p>

  <h2 id="secret-route">Secret Route</h2>
  <p style="margin: 15px 0px;"><span class="dark-bloc red">Spoilers ahead! Proceed with caution.</span></p>
  <p class="spoiler">One part that has not been mentionned yet is <a href="wiki_index.html?page=bone-lord">The Bone Lord</a>, a mysterious figure who seems to have a deep connection to Grimora and the temple. He is said to be able to grant great power to those who serve him, but at a great cost. He is hidden beneath the <a href="wiki_index.html?page=crypt">Crypt</a>, in a <strong>secret area</strong> that can only be accessed by those who know the way.</p>
  <p class="spoiler">To reach him, the player must find <strong>hidden paths</strong> in all areas of the temple. These paths are often purposfully less interesting to follow, as a way to mislead the player. But should they try anyway, they will find a small <strong>shrine</strong> dedicated to the Bone Lord, where they can offer him a <strong>tribute</strong> in exchange for his favor.</p>
  <p class="spoiler">If the player manages to find all 4 shrines and offer a tribute at each one, they will be granted access to the <strong>Bone Lord's lair</strong> beneath the <a href="wiki_index.html?page=crypt">Crypt</a>. There, they will find him waiting, and he will tell them of some <strong>hidden truths</strong> about the game world, before putting them to a <strong>final test</strong>.</p>
  <p class="spoiler">This battle is unlike any other in the game, not being a simple card battle and instead being entirely based on the <strong>chessboard map</strong>. If the player wins, the Bone Lord will sever a <strong>Horn</strong> from its skull and give it to the Player as an Inscrybing tool, as well as an extra <strong>Rare Card</strong>.</p>
