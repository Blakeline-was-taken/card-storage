  <h1>Events</h1>
  <p class="gray">Note: If you want to check out the battle events, see <a href="wiki_index.html?page=battles">Battles</a>.</p>
  <p>Here are listed all the different nodes that exist to help you build your deck. They can be found on the map by exploring the different areas.</p>
  <p>The <strong>Common Events</strong> can be found everywhere relatively frequently, but the other <strong>Temple Events</strong> are locked in their respective temples. On top of that, each Temple Event has an <strong><a href="wiki_index.html?page=collection&areas">Area</a> of Origin</strong>, which must be reached before the event can appear. It will also appear there more than anywhere else.</p>
